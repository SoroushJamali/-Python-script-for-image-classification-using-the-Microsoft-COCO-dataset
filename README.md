Code for COCO dataset classification

#Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks#
This is a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. The notebook uses the TensorFlow library and the Microsoft COCO dataset to train a CNN to classify images of different animals.

**Dataset**
The Microsoft COCO dataset contains a large collection of images with object annotations. In this notebook, we will use a subset of the dataset that includes images of animals. The animal images are classified into the following categories: 'bird', 'cat', 'dog', 'horse', 'sheep', 'cow', 'elephant', 'bear', 'zebra', and 'giraffe'.

**Usage**
To use this notebook, simply open the link and follow the instructions. The notebook includes sections on data preparation, model training, and model evaluation. You can also use the trained model to make predictions on new images by replacing path/to/image.jpg with the actual path to your image file.

Note that you may need to adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters depending on the size and complexity of your dataset.

**Requirements**
This notebook requires the following libraries to be installed:

TensorFlow
NumPy
OpenCV
wget
tarfile
You can install these libraries using the !pip install command in the notebook.

Happy learning!
